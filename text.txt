It takes something more than intelligence to act intelligently.
Taking a new step, uttering a new word, is what people fear most.
Right or wrong, it's very pleasant to break something from time to time.
But how could you live and have no story to tell?
The darker the night, the brighter the stars, The deeper the grief, the closer is God!
